1.  What’s stdint.h? 
    Part of the standard library to provide a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types using macros.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    To ensure a program will have the correct amount of space.
    
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? 
    BYTE: 1 byte (8 bits), DWORD: 4 bytes (32 bits), LONG: 4 bytes (32 bits), WORD: 2 bytes (16 bits).
    
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    BM
    
5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    biSize: the number of bytes required by the structure. bfSize: the number of bytes required by the bitmap file.
    
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    the image is top down from the the top left hand corner.
    
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    biBitCount
    
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    if the file cannot be opened or allow writing privleges.
    
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    this specifies how many elements to read.
    
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
    padding =  (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4;
    padding =  (4 - (9 % 4) % 4;
    padding =  (4 - 1) % 4;
    padding =  3.
    
11. What does fseek do?
    looks for padding and changes the file position in relation to this.
    
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    this macro is an integar constant used to offset the file position.
